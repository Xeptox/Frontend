    My name is Anton. I was born in 1984 at Soviet Union and lived there until USSR fall , after i lived in Russia until
    age 12.
    In 1996 we moved to Israel.I was learning in school and after school i made my army service.
    To be programmer was my dream in school in Israel.
    So i always read something about it and coding sometimes and also liked all about computers and technologies.
    So now i decided to learn programming deeper and work in.</p>
